			</h2>
			<p>One of the smaller Bond Street Picture Galleries. The entrance is from a picture shop. Nearly in the middle of the gallery there is a writing-table, at which the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Secretary</b>, fashionably dressed, sits with his back to the entrance, correcting catalogue proofs. Some copies of a new book are on the desk, also the Secretary’s shining hat and a couple of magnifying glasses. At the side, on his left, a little behind him, is a small door marked “Private.” Near the same side is a cushioned bench parallel to the walls, which are covered with Dubedat’s works. Two screens, also covered with drawings, stand near the corners right and left of the entrance.</p>

Proceeding with his survey, he disappears behind the screen. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Jennifer</b> comes back with her book. A look round satisfies her that she is alone. She seats herself at the table and admires the memoir⁠—her first printed book⁠—to her heart’s content. Ridgeon reappears, face to the wall, scrutinizing the drawings. After using his glass again, he steps back to get a more distant view of one of the larger pictures. She hastily closes the book at the sound; looks round; recognizes him; and stares, petrified.

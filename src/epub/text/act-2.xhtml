			<p>After dinner on the terrace at the Star and Garter, Richmond. Cloudless summer night; nothing disturbs the stillness except from time to time the long trajectory of a distant train and the measured clucking of oars coming up from the Thames in the valley below. The dinner is over; and three of the eight chairs are empty. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Sir Patrick</b>, with his back to the view, is at the head of the square table with <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Ridgeon</b>. The two chairs opposite them are empty. On their right come, first, a vacant chair, and then one very fully occupied by <b epub:type="z3998:persona"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">B.B.</abbr></b>, who basks blissfully in the moonbeams. On their left, <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Schutzmacher</b> and <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Walpole</b>. The entrance to the hotel is on their right, behind <b epub:type="z3998:persona"><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">B.B.</abbr></b> The five men are silently enjoying their coffee and cigarettes, full of food, and not altogether void of wine.</p>
			<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Dubedat</b>, wrapped up for departure, comes in. They rise, except <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Sir Patrick</b>; but she takes one of the vacant places at the foot of the table, next <b epub:type="z3998:persona"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">B.B.</abbr></b>; and they sit down again.</p>

He has turquoise blue eyes, and a trick of looking you straight in the face with them, which, combined with a frank smile, is very engaging. Although he is all nerves, and very observant and quick of apprehension, he is not in the least shy. He is younger than Jennifer; but he patronizes her as a matter of course. The doctors do not put him out in the least: neither <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Sir Patrick’s</b> years nor <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Bloomfield Bonington’s</b> majesty have the smallest apparent effect on him: he is as natural as a cat: he moves among men as most men move among things, though he is intentionally making himself agreeable to them on this occasion. Like all people who can be depended on to take care of themselves, he is welcome company; and his artist’s power of appealing to the imagination gains him credit for all sorts of qualities and powers, whether he possesses them or not.</i>

But in money matters it’s quite different. You see, when an Englishman borrows, all he knows or cares is that he wants money; and he’ll sign anything to get it, without in the least understanding it, or intending to carry out the agreement if it turns out badly for him. In fact, he thinks you a cad if you ask him to carry it out under such circumstances. Just like the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Merchant of Venice</i>, you know. But if a Jew makes an agreement, he means to keep it and expects you to keep it. If he wants money for a time, he borrows it and knows he must pay it at the end of the time.
